# A Tribute to Chester Bennington ðŸ™ŒðŸŽ¤
# :nerd_face: my-first-repo :man_student: 


## **Description**

- This is my first push to github from when I first began my coding journey...
- HTML contains a super basic layout that is a tribute to Chester Bennington, the late lead singer of Linkin Park. 
- The motivation behind this was to pay a tribute, build my understanding of HTML.
- While building this site, I began my first steps with HTML while paying tribute to one of my favorite artists. 
- This README is here to serve the purpose of having a professional ReadME for all repos.
- Again, thank you for reading this far into it, this is simply my first attempt at pushing HTML to Github.
- Please let me know what you think :smile:
